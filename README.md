#HackerWorld

## About the game
Hacker world takes the player through an adventure where the possibilities are limitless.
As the user travels through the different terrains, the player learns about the value of programming as well
as some of the basics. 

This 2D game is controlled by using computer commands. Instead of making the player remember a series of lines of commands in order to play the game, we decided to make the game a click-in-order-and-go control game.
The way it works is that for every time commands are needed the game will show you a list of possible commands. The player has to choose the right commands as well as having to choose them in the right order. This makes it easy for the user to learn the various commands as well as adds a different level of difficulty to the game

As the story takes you through very interactive missions, every checkpoint will give you Arduino Code that you can hit run on your computer to test it out in an actual Arduino UNO Board. All the missions in the game are Arduino programming related, meaning that by the time you finish the game you should have solid knowledge on how Arduino works and how to make it perform the actions you want. Arduino code given by checkpoints is ready to be downloaded. It also includes instruction on how to run it and what/how to plug sensors/objects needed for the Arduino UNO Board.

You get the best of the two worlds. Beginner introduction to programming while learning a tool such Arduino that will let you take your ideas to the next level. All of this in a simple and interactive Web/mobile game.
